  title : "A three days workshop dedicated to the actuality of the Greek Anthology"
  image : "images/sappho.jpg"
  content : |
    The languages and literatures of Antiquity, especially of Greece, are omnipresent in our culture and in the construction of our Western societies. With the birth and development of the Internet on the one hand, and the Web on the other, more and more projects for the digitization, indexing, digital publishing, and computational studies of these texts are emerging.   
    What are the implications of this encounter between texts that are sometimes several millennia old and digital platforms? What to do with the innumerable data generated? How can we appropriate these digitized heritages, contribute to their dissemination, and exploit them for heuristic purposes? What digital and computational tools can we use to further our knowledge of these vast bodies of work, which are far from having revealed all their secrets?   
    The event "Anthological Navigations" intends to raise these questions by focusing in particular on the case study of the Greek Anthology, a monumental work for which the Canada Research Chair in Digital Writing is producing a collaborative digital edition.
    This meeting will take place over three days with the aim of calling on the community of Digital Classicists to reflect on the scientific issues related to the dissemination of the heritage of ancient Greek languages and literatures and, more generally, on the methodological and epistemological impacts of the Digital Humanities within the framework of Hellenistic studies, based on the case study of the Greek Anthology. 
    While focusing on the anthological corpus, the three days of the conference aim to bridge the gap between the terms "digital" and "classicists", to provoke a meeting between researchers, professors and programmers with diverse profiles and sometimes distant interests, so that a perennial discussion can be created and new research potentialities can emerge.

    # speaker
    - speaker : "Lucia FLORIDI (Alma Mater Studiorum - Università di Bologna)"
      subject : "Editing Greek epigrams. Methods and problems."
      abstract:  |
        Our knowledge of Greek epigrammatic poetry is mainly based on two fundamental works: the *Palatine Anthology* (PA) and the *Anthology of Planudes* (APl). Minor works are added to these, called *Syllogae Minores*. Some epigrams are also known through indirect tradition (authors like Athenaeus), or transmitted from papyri or inscriptions. The editors of the Anthology are thus confronted with a complex and changing textual translation, ranging from a textus unicus to much more varied situations. I will illustrate, in the course of my presentation, the main problems - of critical, textual and exegetical nature - that I have encountered in my capacity as editor of several epigrammatic authors (Strato, Lucillius, Hedylus in particular).
      biography : |

      subject : "Teaching greek with the *Greek Anthology*'s riddles."
      abstract : |
        According to the preface of Constantine Cephalas, the epigrams of the fourteenth book of the *Palatine Anthology* had a pedagogical purpose: the problems were useful to teach mathematics; the riddles to teach the language. Can these last enigmatic epigrams be useful today to teach Greek language and, in addition, classical mythology? By comparing these little poems to other poetic riddles testified in Greek and Byzantine literature, this paper will prove that the pedagogical function evoked by Cephalas can still be exploited today.

      subject : "Experiences and perspectives of the study of ancient Greek between school and *Digital Humanities*: a possible *Fortleben* of the *Palatine Anthology*."
      abstract : |
        For the past few years, a pilot experiment in some high schools has been trying to create a way of working in the field of Digital Humanities on the basis of Greek texts : starting from knowledge to elaborate a research paradigm through translation. Epigrams from the Palatine Anthology are translated in participatory translation workshops starting with the digital version of the ancient manuscript from the 10th century BCE. C., put online by the Perseus Project. On the basis of the Greek poetic text, this practice seeks to identify a possible *Fortleben* of ancient Wisdom in contemporary culture (from music to iconographic arts).
        Associating Greek repertories with digital tools sharing different translations and connections to contemporary culture (cf. Website Anthologiagraeca.org) goes to fill a gap and builds a useful bridge between the school system and the Academia.
      biography : |
        Annalisa di Vincenzo, PhD in Greek and Latin Philology, has been teaching Classics at Samuele Cagnazzi's liceo classico Luca in Altamura since 2005. Following a specialization in programming for didactic, her teaching methods are motivated by the inclusion of digital tools in the classroom. For several years, the Greek Anthology held at the CRCDT project has benefited from important contributions thanks to the involvement of her students in the editing process on the project platform.

    - speaker : "Serena CANNAVALE (Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II)"
      subject : "Inside and beyond the *Greek Anthology*. New directions and challenges in the study of Callimachean epigrams."
      abstract : | 
        Recent years saw an increasing critical in-depth analysis of the epigrammatic literature, resulting in large-scale studies both on epigrams of epigraphic tradition and on those of literary tradition and their mutual interplay. Such interest was mostly encouraged by the publication of the Posidippus papyrus, which stimulated new studies on the construction of ancient anthologies and on the arrangement of books of epigrams. Nevertheless, the lack of a recent edition with commentary of Callimachus' epigrams stands out very conspicuously, even though many individual poems have been the object of accurate analysis in valuable papers and monographic studies. Moving from these important recent acquisitions, it is now evident that a modern commentary to callimachean epigrams should relate the individual texts to the epigrammatic tradition as a whole, focusing both on the literary parallels within the Greek Anthology and on their epigraphic counterparts. The present paper will suggest to apply this approach through three lines of investigation:1) paying attention to traditional epigrammatic sub-genres (votive, sepulchral, epideictic, erotic etc.) and to their realizations within the Callimachean corpus, all the while considering how traditional categories have permeable boundaries, not so easy to be traced (consider for example the problematic case of the label of ‘epideictic’ or ‘ecphrastic’ epigram); 2) studying the continuity of transversal topoi and motifs through these sub-genres (e.g. epigrams on misanthropes; epigrams on poets or poetic works; bucolic themes); 3) considering the possibility to relate Callimachus’ epigrams to less known typologies, like those emerging from the Posidippus papyrus (e.g. *nauagika*).

      subject : "Uses and enhancements of the digital facsimile of the *Palatine Anthology*."
      abstract : |
        The first and largest part of the *Palatine Anthology* (University Library of Heidelberg, Codex Palatinus Graecus 23) has been available as a digital facsimile since 2009. Since then scholars and anyone interested can freely access high quality images of the codex which was previously only available in critical editions or rare and expensive printed facsimiles. This presentation will examine the features of the digital facsimile and its presentation in the website of the University Library of Heidelberg which uses the software DWork. Particular attention will be given to the annotations created jointly and cooperatively between scholars in Heidelberg and Montreal. Finally, existing cases and future possibilities of reuse of the images will be discussed.

    - speaker : "Marie-Claire BEAULIEU (Tufts University, Classics)"
      subject : "Revealing latent information in a reference text: the digital edition of the *Glossary of Greek Birds*"
      abstract : |
        This contribution explores the opportunities offered by digital publishing for non-linear texts. Like the *Palatine Anthology*, D'Arcy Thompson's *Glossary of Greek Birds* (1896 and 1936) was designed to be read flexibly according to the reader's interests and cross-reference networks. While it is primarily a reference work - essentially a list of Greek bird names combined with ornithological identification through descriptions provided by ancient texts - the most interesting aspect of the *Glossary* is what it does not explicitly say, for the references to the ancient texts cover a wealth of information about the literary, mythological, and historical associations of the birds cited as well as the relationships among them. This paper will detail the encoding techniques and processes such as formal concept analysis employed by the project to bring out this information and use it as a tool to navigate through the text.

      subject : "*Opera Graeca Adnotata*: an open source corpus for annotated Ancient Greek texts."
      abstract : |
        This contribution aims to present the *Opera Graeca Adnotata* (OGA) corpus. OGA provides morphosyntactic annotations for most Ancient Greek texts of the Perseus Digital Library. More precisely, OGA contains 489 annotated files (6,488,472 tokens and 347,517 sentences). In order for the corpus to be scalable, annotations in OGA are standoff following the PAULA XML formalism. Currently, the OGA corpus represents the largest open source annotated resource for Ancient Greek, in that both texts and the attached annotations can be freely queried and reused under a CC BY-NC 4.0 licence.
      biography : |
        Giuseppe Celano's academic profile is situated at the very interface between humanities (linguistics and classics) and computer science. he started his academic career as a classicist, with a focus on the study of Ancient Greek and Latin grammar. He earned his PhD in Classical Philology in 2008, with a thesis on word order in Plato's Phaedo. He was a research fellow for a German-Italian research project on argument structure in Ancient Greek and Yucatec Maya, run at the University of Erfurt and Pavia, in 2012-2013. Subsequently, in late 2013, he joined the Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at Leipzig University to work on the treebank of Ancient Greek and Latin. In April 2018, he joined the Natural Language Processing group of Leipzig University, where he worked until September 2018 on a DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) project on actionality classes and coding asymmetries. In the same Institute, he has been an independent DFG researcher since October 2018, working on annotation of Ancient Greek and Latin data.

      subject : "Feature Importance for Authorship Attribution of Ancient Greek Pseudepigrapha and Forgeries."
      abstract : |
        In its simplest form, authorship attribution compares a single suspect text to a larger body of known-authentic texts by identifying anachronisms of history, grammar, and vocabulary. For instance, Lorenzo Valla refuted ancient authorship of the *Donatio Constantini* by finding grammatical mistakes and turns of phrase that would have been implausible in the 4th century. While the textual critic chooses distinguishing characteristics relevant to the investigation of a specific text, can we generalize about how useful particular features are across all authorship inquiries? This lecture provides quantitative information about the relative importance of categories of features (part-of-speech, syntax, vocabulary, and semantics) to three types of authorship attribution tasks: 1) disambiguation of two authors of the same genre (e.g., Thucydides vs. Polybius); 2) pseudepigrapha, anonymous texts mistakenly attributed during antiquity or the Middle Ages to a known author (e.g., Aristotle vs. Pseudo-Aristotle); and 3) forgeries from the Renaissance through the early Modern era (e.g., Erasmus's *De duplici martyrio*). In a series of experiments, attribution of dubious texts is approached as a supervised machine learning task. Using features directly from the Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK) and the same non-optimized algorithm for each comparison, this investigation provides insights into both stylometry for Ancient Greek literature and the utility of the natural language processing (NLP) for authorship attribution.

      subject : "AI for ancient languages, insights for small corpus processing."
      abstract : |
        Language modeling systems via *deep learning* are dependent on clean and massive data. However, such data does not exist for all languages and all eras. It is therefore necessary to go through other less traditional ways, especially if we want to study the way ancient texts were translated. Indeed, translations are only loosely aligned with the various source texts to which they refer, especially since translation modes and requirements change over time. The challenge of AI for translatology and ancient languages is therefore, among other things, to study the evolution of the perception and transmission of ancient texts "blindly", i.e. without any theoretical preconceptions, in order to re-examine previously unverifiable hypotheses and, if necessary, to propose new ones. We propose to apply our reflection to a particular case study, the French translations of the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey* of the 16th and 17th centuries.

      subject : "The Aftermath of Plato. Searching for Traces in Vector Space."
      abstract : |
        This lecture presents different approaches and tools we developed within the project Digital Plato for the investigation of the aftermath and reception of Plato’s work. The essential aspect was the search for intertextual references to Plato in Ancient Greek literature, especially text passages that have been paraphrased by other authors. One of our approaches, which will be explained here in detail, makes use of word embeddings and the Word Mover’s Distance (WMD) in particular to identify them. It was integrated into a comprehensive, web-based work environment that allows the exploratory analysis of such references. In fact, the tools developed for the Platonic works became so generic, that the application for studying the development of the aftermath and reception of other ancient authors within the corpus is possible too.
      biography : |
         Marcus Pöckelmann studied computer science at the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (Master 2013) and has been a member of the research group Molitor/Ritter since 2013. Within several interdisciplinary research projects he develops web-based applications for the investigation of intertextuality together with colleagues from different disciplines of the humanities. These include the working environments *LERA* for the analysis of complex text variants for scholarly editions, and Paraphrasis for the retrieval and evaluation of paraphrased text passages in the ancient Greek literature.
