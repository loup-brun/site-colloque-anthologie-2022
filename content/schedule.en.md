      subject : "Editing Greek Epigrams: Methods and Problems."
      abstract:  |
        Our knowledge of Greek epigrammatic poetry is mainly based on two fundamental works: the *Palatine Anthology* (PA) and the *Anthology of Planudes* (APl). Minor works are added to these, called *Syllogae Minores*. Some epigrams are also known through indirect tradition (with authors like Athenaeus), or transmitted from papyri or inscriptions. The editors of the *Anthology* are thus confronted with a complex and changing textual translation, ranging from a *textus unicus* to much more varied situations. I will illustrate, in the course of my presentation, the main problems - of critical, textual and exegetical nature - that I have encountered in my capacity as editor of several epigrammatic authors (Strato, Lucillius, Hedylus in particular).

      subject : "Teaching Greek with the Riddles of the *Palatine Anthology*."
      abstract : |
        According to the preface of Constantine Cephalas, the epigrams of the fourteenth book of the Palatine Anthology had a pedagogical purpose: the problems were useful to teach mathematics; the riddles to teach the language. Can these last enigmatic epigrams be useful today to teach Greek language and, in addition, classical mythology? By comparing these little poems to other poetic riddles testified in Greek and Byzantine literature, this paper will prove that the pedagogical function evoked by Cephalas can still be exploited today.
      biography : |
        Simone Beta is Professor of Classical Philology at the University of Siena. He is the author of numerous monographs and articles on multiple topics such as ancient theatre, rhetoric, epigrammatic poetry (especially enigmas and oracles) and reception of classical culture in the modern era. Regarding comedy, he has mostly worked on Aristophanes and his adpatations. Among his latest publications, we cite *Io, un manoscritto : l’Antologia Palatina si racconta*, (2019) – which has been translated in french and published by Les Belles Lettres – and *Il labirinto della parola. Enigmi, oracoli e sogni nella cultura antica*, (2016).

      subject : "Inside and Beyond the *Greek Anthology*: New Directions and Challenges in the Study of Callimachean Epigrams."
      abstract : | 
        Recent years saw a critical analysis of increasing depth of epigrammatic literature, resulting in large-scale studies both on epigrams of epigraphic tradition and on those of literary tradition, and their mutual interplay. Such interest was mostly encouraged by the publication of the Posidippus papyrus, which stimulated new studies on the construction of ancient anthologies and on the arrangement of books of epigrams. Nevertheless, the lack of a recent edition with commentary of Callimachus' epigrams stands out very conspicuously, even though many individual poems have been the object of accurate analysis in valuable papers and monographic studies. Moving from these important recent acquisitions, it is now evident that a modern commentary to Callimachean epigrams should link the individual texts to the epigrammatic tradition as a whole, focusing both on the literary parallels within the *Greek Anthology* and on their epigraphic counterparts. The present talk suggests to apply this approach through three lines of investigation: 1) paying attention to traditional epigrammatic sub-genres (votive, sepulchral, epideictic, erotic, etc.) and to their realizations within the Callimachean corpus, while considering how traditional categories have permeable boundaries that are not so easily traced (consider for example the problematic case of the label of “epideictic” or “ecphrastic” epigram); 2) studying the continuity of transversal topoi and motifs through these sub-genres (e.g. epigrams on misanthropes; epigrams on poets or poetic works; bucolic themes); 3) considering the possibility to relate Callimachus’ epigrams to less known typologies, like those emerging from the Posidippus papyrus (e.g. *nauagika*).

      abstract : |
        For the past few years, a pilot experiment in some high schools has been trying to create a way of working in the field of Digital Humanities on the basis of Greek texts: to start from knowledge to then elaborate a research paradigm through translation skills. Epigrams from the Palatine Anthology are translated in participatory translation workshops starting with the digital version of the ancient manuscript from the 10<sup>th</sup> century BCE, put online by the Perseus Project. On the basis of the Greek poetic text, this practice seeks to identify a possible *Fortleben* of ancient wisdom in contemporary culture (from music to iconographic arts). Associating Greek repertories with digital tools enables the sharing of different translations and connections to contemporary culture (cf. website Anthologiagraeca.org), and goes to fill a gap as well as build a useful bridge between the school system and academia.

      abstract : |
        The first and largest part of the *Palatine Anthology*'s manuscript (Codex Palatinus Graecus 23) has been available as a digital facsimile since 2009 at the University Library of Heidelberg. Since then scholars and anyone interested can freely access high quality images of the codex which was previously only available in critical editions or rare and expensive printed facsimiles. This presentation will examine the features of the digital facsimile and its presentation in the website of the University Library of Heidelberg which uses the software DWork. Particular attention will be given to the annotations created jointly and cooperatively between scholars in Heidelberg and Montreal. Finally, existing cases and future possibilities of reuse of the images will be discussed.

      subject : "Revealing Latent Information in a Reference Text: the Digital Edition of the *Glossary of Greek Birds*"
      abstract : |
        This contribution explores the opportunities offered by digital publishing for non-linear texts. Like the *Palatine Anthology*, D'Arcy Thompson's *Glossary of Greek Birds* (1896 and 1936) was designed to be read flexibly according to the reader's interests and cross-reference networks. While it is primarily a reference work - essentially a list of Greek bird names combined with ornithological identification through descriptions provided by ancient texts - the most interesting aspect of the *Glossary* is what it does not explicitly say, for the references to the ancient texts cover a wealth of information about the literary, mythological, and historical associations of the birds cited as well as the relationships among them. This talk will detail the encoding techniques and processes such as formal concept analysis employed by the project to bring out this information and use it as a tool to navigate through the text.

      abstract : |
        This contribution aims to present the [Opera Graeca Adnotata (OGA)](http://oga.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/it/index.html) corpus. OGA provides morphosyntactic annotations for most Ancient Greek texts of the Perseus Digital Library. In order for the corpus to be scalable, annotations in OGA are following PAULA XML formalism. Currently, the OGA corpus represents the largest open source annotated resource for Ancient Greek, in that both texts and the attached annotations can be freely queried and reused under a CC BY-NC 4.0 licence.
      biography : |
        Giuseppe Celano’s academic profile is at the intersection between humanities (linguistics and classics) and computer science. He started his academic career as a classicist, with a focus on the study of Ancient Greek and Latin grammar. He obtained his PhD in Classical Philology in 2008, with a thesis on word order in Plato’s *Phaedo*. He was a research fellow for a German-Italian research project on the structure of the argument in Ancient Greek and Yucatec Mayan, run at the University of Erfurt and Pavia, from 2012-2013. Subsequently, in late 2013, he joined the Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at Leipzig University to work on Ancient Greek and Latin treebanks. In April 2018, he joined the Natural Language Processing Group of Leipzig University, where he worked until September 2018 on a DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) project on actionality classes and coding asymmetries. In the same Institute, he has been an independent DFG researcher since October 2018, working on the annotation of Ancient Greek and Latin data.

      subject : "Feature Importance for Authorship Attribution of Ancient Greek Pseudepigrapha and Forgeries."
      abstract : |
        In its simplest form, authorship attribution compares a single suspect text to a larger body of known-authentic texts by identifying anachronisms of history, grammar, and vocabulary. For instance, Lorenzo Valla refuted ancient authorship of the *Donatio Constantini* by finding grammatical mistakes and turns of phrase that would have been implausible in the 4<sup>th</sup> century. While the textual critic chooses distinguishing characteristics relevant to the investigation of a specific text, can we generalize about how useful particular features are across all authorship inquiries? This lecture provides quantitative information about the relative importance of categories of features (part-of-speech, syntax, vocabulary, and semantics) to three types of authorship attribution tasks: 1) disambiguation of two authors of the same genre (e.g., Thucydides vs. Polybius); 2) pseudepigrapha, anonymous texts mistakenly attributed during antiquity or the Middle Ages to a known author (e.g., Aristotle vs. Pseudo-Aristotle); and 3) forgeries from the Renaissance through the early Modern era (e.g., Erasmus's *De duplici martyrio*). In a series of experiments, attribution of dubious texts is approached as a supervised machine learning task. Using features directly from the Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK) and the same non-optimized algorithm for each comparison, this investigation provides insights into both stylometry for Ancient Greek literature and the utility of the natural language processing (NLP) for authorship attribution.

      subject : "The Aftermath of Plato. Searching for Traces in Vector Space."
      abstract : |
        This lecture presents different approaches and tools we developed within the project *Digital Plato* for the investigation of the aftermath and reception of Plato’s work. The essential aspect was the search for intertextual references to Plato in ancient Greek literature, especially text passages that have been paraphrased by other authors. One of our approaches, which will be explained here in detail, makes use of word embeddings and the Word Mover’s Distance (WMD) in particular to identify them. It was integrated into a comprehensive, web-based work environment that allows the exploratory analysis of such references. In fact, the tools developed for the Platonic works have become so versatile that they can also be applied to the study of aftermath and reception development of other ancient authors within the corpus.

      subject : "AI for ancient languages, insights for small corpus processing."
      abstract : |
        Language modeling systems via deep learning are dependent on clean and massive data. However, such data does not exist for all languages nor eras. It is therefore necessary to go through other less traditional ways, especially if we want to study the way ancient texts were translated. Indeed, translations are only loosely aligned with the various source texts to which they refer, especially since translation modes and requirements change over time. The challenge of AI use for translatology and ancient languages is found therefore, among other things, in the “blind” study of ancient texts’ perception and transmission evolution, i.e. without any theoretical preconceptions, in order to re-examine previously unverifiable hypotheses and, if necessary, to offer new ones. We propose to apply our reflection to a particular case study, the 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup>-century French translations of the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey*.
