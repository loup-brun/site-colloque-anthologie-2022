Marcello Vitali-Rosati is a Professor in the Department of French Language Literatures at the University of Montreal and holds the Canada Research Chair in Digital Textualities. He is developing a philosophical reflection on the challenges of digital technologies: the concept of virtuality, digital identity, the notions of author and authority, the forms of production, legitimization and circulation of knowledge in the age of the web, and the theory of editorialization -- to which he is one of the most active contributors. He is the author of numerous articles and monographs, and also works as an editor as director of the journal *Sens public* and co-director of the collection “Parcours Numériques” at the Presses de l’Université de Montréal (University of Montreal Press). As holder of the Chair in Digital Textualities, he directs several projects in digital humanities, particularly in the field of scholarly publishing. In this context, he has developed publishing platforms for enriched journals and monographs, software for scientific paper editing, and a collaborative publishing platform for the Codex Palatinus 23.
