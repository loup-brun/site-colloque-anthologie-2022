{{< faq "Description of the event" >}}
In pluridisciplinary teams, participants will compete to present prototypes that use algorithmic methods in order explore and analyse the corpus of the *Greek Anthology*. Participants will have the opportunity to test the project’s APIs ("For a digital and collaborative edition of the *Greek Anthology*") and our partners' (such as the Palatine Library of Heidelberg, or the Perseus Digital Library). This last day will allow the use of what was produced during the CRCEN's « Greek Anthology » project on the one hand, and during the workshop on the other hand, while bringing out new potentialities of research.

{{< faq "Description of the data sets" >}}
Developed as part of the project “For A Collaborative Digital Edition of the Greek Anthology” led by the Canada Research Chair on Digital Textualities, the API containing the data for the hackathon is available [here](https://anthologiagraeca.org/api/).  
It provides a JSON representation of all the data in the platform.

{{< faq "Objectives">}}
Considering the vast array of skills and knowledge of the participants, we want to keep the objectives as flexible as possible. Thus, we offer only one guideline: each project must make use of the corpus in a creative and technical way.  
Scholars and students alike will participate in a quick training on the API and corpus, and in a brainstorming session, before pitching projects to the participants.  
Each team will be constituted of at least one guest with a technological profile and another with a philological profile, to help guide the selected projects.

<!-- {{< faq "Subjects" >}}
Each discussion group will be given a list of potential subjects. They are welcome to use or discard them as they see fit.

Some examples of themes and ideas :
- Tweet-bot 
- Taxonomy 
- Variations finding 
- Data visualization 
- Specialized searching tools
- Automatic alignment 
- Pre-processing and lemmatization of the corpus
