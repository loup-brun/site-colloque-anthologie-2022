{{< faq "Description of the event" >}}
In multidisciplinary teams, participants will compete to present prototypes that use algorithmic methods to explore and analyse the corpus of the Greek Anthology. Participants will have the opportunity to test the project’s APIs (“Pour une édition numérique collaborative de l’Anthologie grecque”) and our partners' (such as the Palatine Library of Heidelberg, or the Perseus Digital Library). This last day will allow the use of what was produced during the Greek Anthology project and workshop as a launchpad, but also to bring out new research potentialities.

{{< faq "Description of the data sets" >}}
Developed within the framework of the project "For a collaborative digital edition of the *Greek Anthology*" led by the Canada Research Chair on Digital Writings, the API containing the data for the hackathon is available [here](https://anthologiagraeca.org/api/).  
It provides a JSON representation of all the data in the platform.

{{< faq "Objectives">}}
Considering the vast array of skills and knowledge of the participants, we want to keep the objectives as flexible as possible. Thus, we offer only one guideline: each project must make use of the corpus in a creative and technical way. Scholars and students alike will participate in a quick training on the API and corpus, and in a brainstorming session, before pitching projects to the participants. Each team will be constituted of at least one guest with a technological profile and another with a philological profile, to help guide the selected projects.
